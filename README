mo                                            v1.0.0.0

Use the fewest possible keystrokes to set DOS or Git Bash 
window sizes. Resize fast, without a mouse. 

Sets Console Window & Buffer Sizes, QuickEdit, other options 
from command line. 

Setup in two steps: (1) download the mo.zip file, and 
(2) unzip content into a folder on your windows path. 

Alternatively, you can fork or clone this project on GitHub, 
change, and rebuild to make your own complete mo.zip.

"mo" also works in Console 2, because Console 2 is a wrapper 
of DOS and Git Bash consoles.

The "mo" program runs on either BCL 2.0 or 4.0 .Net versions.
It has been successfully tested on installed .Net frameworks
between 2.0 and 4.5 and on Windows XP through Windows 8.

This new "mo" solution has been rewritten using guidelines
learned in the Manning book Dependency Injection in .Net.
This solution structure is similar to UpdateCurrency. It
includes fixes and new features since the old "mo" version.

The solution was built using Visual Studio 2010. Good luck.
